# San Jose: Empty Schools
Investigating the trends in demographics for school closures in San Jose.

This is where the code for this project lives. [Visit the website at http://zeroclutch.github.io/emptyschools/](http://zeroclutch.github.io/emptyschools/).

### Project Outline

Empty Schools is an interactive infographic that allows people to explore the different demographics of the regions where school closures happen the most in San Jose.

### Motivations

* Shedd's analysis of Chicago public schools took into account the dynamics and demographics of the region
* She provided very visual representations in maps to illustrate her points
* Curious to see what factors seem to correlate with school closures Ã  la Ewing
* There was much more data than I could put in an infographic

### Visualization
* Map divided into regions by zip code.
* Each region can be shaded based on a certain metric, e.g. income, population, cost of living, or ethnicity.

### Disclaimers
* Since schools can close and reopen for a number of reasons, the context behind the closures are relevant.
  * The data behind the school closures may be incomplete, since there's no true source of information for this.
* This was collected from the CA Department of Education's school directory, but much of the information is from reports from the public.
* Not all shading information is a percentage, such as income or population, so the amount of shading can't be compared across different filters
